#### Project was made with DataCamp

<h1 style"align-text=center;"> Project: Super Bowl Analytics </h1>
 A simple project about Data Manipulation to answer some questions about Super Bowl using his data.
 
## What I use?

I use Python and some Csv files.
  In python i use the following libs:
    <ul>
      <li> pandas </li>
      <li> matplotlib </li>
      <li> seaborn </li>
    </ul>
    

## What I do?

First I get some NFL data, how musicians was singing on Super Bowl (number of musics played, audience, etc.), Super Bowl team's (winners, difference between teams in final, etc.) and TV (audience during Final, etc.).

After this, i coding to create some graphs with 'matplotlib' to analyze some team's dominant performances, more musics played by a musician, etc and resolve issues as missing values.

## Main questions to be answer during coding

  <ul>
    <li>Point difference between team's during final</li>
      <ul>
        <li> What's the minor difference? </li>
        <li> What's the biggest difference? </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Is when the difference is minor the audience its biggest? </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Ad industry during Super Bowl (Tv)</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Is Ad costs turned biggest on these days? </li>
      </ul>
